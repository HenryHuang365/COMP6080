Second happy path: push and multiple user
The second test first test if the user can navigate to rootpage,
the user should go to the dashboard since dashboard page is root page.
The user should go to the hosted listing page and create and push a property,
then the created property that is not previously visible in the dashboard is visible
now. When user logout, they still can access the dashboard and see their published
property, a random user who does not login also can see the property if it's published
by someone
